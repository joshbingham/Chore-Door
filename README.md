- Implemented a local storage-based scoring system to track wins, losses, streaks, and best streak across sessions.
- Developed modular functions for state management, randomised door allocation, and dynamic UI updates.
- Enhanced usability with a live scoreboard and replay workflow, improving overall user experience and code maintainability.
